In SQL, a foreign key is a field or set of fields in a table that refers to the primary key of another table. The primary key of the referenced table is used to ensure the referential integrity of the data.

A foreign key creates a link between two tables, allowing data in one table to be related to data in another table. For example, if you have a table called "orders" and a table called "customers", you might have a foreign key in the "orders" table that references the primary key of the "customers" table. This allows you to link each order to the customer who placed it.

Foreign keys are used to enforce referential integrity, which ensures that data in the related tables is consistent and accurate. It also helps to prevent data from becoming orphaned or inconsistent. For example, if a foreign key is defined and a record in the primary key table is deleted, the corresponding records in the table with the foreign key will also be deleted.

You can create a foreign key constraint using the FOREIGN KEY keyword in the CREATE TABLE statement or using ALTER TABLE command to add a foreign key to an existing table.
