".env" is a file format commonly used in programming to store environment variables, which are values that can be used to configure and customize the behavior of an application. In the context of SQL, a ".env" file may contain configuration settings such as database credentials, connection strings, and other information that is specific to the environment where the application is running. The use of environment variables allows for separation of configuration data from the application code, making it easier to manage and maintain.
